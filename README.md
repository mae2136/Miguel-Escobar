## Credits

I would like to thank my wife, Amanda, for watching me struggle with formatting, and giving me suggestions for colors and the design of the website. This site would not look as nice as it does without her.

I would also like to credit my teacher, teaching assistant, and current classmates at Northwestern bootcamp for providing me the resources to practice and create a the website you see here.
