                    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
                    <p>My name is Miguel Escobar, and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am currently learning how to become a web developer at Northwestern University in order to change my career. While its a scary thing to do, I am having a blast learning how to make web applications!</p>
                    <p>While I figure out how to be a web developer, I work full time at Medline, LP as a Sr. Engineer in the Research and Development department, helping to bring medical devices to market. I've been in the industry almost 10 years now, having worked my way up from a laboratory technician to now validating test equipment and ensuring compliance with all Regulatory standards for all sorts of medical devices.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not busy with work and changing careers, I am out playing board and video games with my family and friends. And fun fact: I'm expecting to be a father later this year!</p>

                    <p>In collaboration with the rest of the team members of the Better Booze Bureau, I helped program the site, Taco'bout Hoppiness. This site pulls up nearby breweries, taco places near those breweries, and stores those combinations for future reference.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am very happy to have worked with a team on this, as the site is feature rich and has lots of fun easter eggs that were only possible through team work.</p>
