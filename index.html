                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio site!</p>
                    <p>My name is Miguel Escobar, and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am currently learning how to
                        become a web developer at Northwestern University in order to change my career. While its a
                        scary thing to do, I am having a blast learning how to make web applications!</p>
                    <p>I current work full time at Medline, LP as a Sr. Engineer
                        in the Research and Development department, helping to bring medical devices to market. I've
                        been in the industry almost 10 years now, having worked my way up from a laboratory technician
                        to now validating test equipment and ensuring compliance with U.S. and International Regulatory
                        standards for all
                        sorts of medical devices.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not busy with work and changing careers, I am out playing board and video games with my
                        family and friends. And fun fact: I'm going to be a father later this year!</p>

                    <p>Fully Booked is a site to see virtual community libraries in the Chicago area. Users can create
                        libraries and mark them with an address and zip code, add books to the library, and checkk books
                        in or out of other libraries in their area. Non-signed up users are able to browse libraries and
                        see what books they contain.
                    </p>
                    <p>This site was made by the Check Yo Shelves team using Express, Sequelize (MySQL), and Node.js for the
                        Backend, and Handlebars with Bootstrap for the Frontend of the site.
